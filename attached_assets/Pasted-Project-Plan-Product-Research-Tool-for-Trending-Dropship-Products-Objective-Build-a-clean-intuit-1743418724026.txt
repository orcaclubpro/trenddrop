Project Plan: Product Research Tool for Trending Dropship Products

Objective: Build a clean, intuitive tool to identify trending dropship products, their geographic/cultural trends, and associated marketing videos. Focus on high-quality algorithms and actionable metrics.
Core Features & Workflow

    Product Discovery Engine

        Data Sources:

            Social media platforms (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts) for viral product trends.

            E-commerce platforms (AliExpress, Amazon, Shopify stores) for sales velocity.

            Google Trends and Keyword Planner for search volume spikes.

            APIs: TikTok Trends API, AliExpress API, Google Trends API, Shopify web crawler (public store data).

        Scraping Logic:

            Prioritize products with sudden spikes in engagement (likes, shares, comments) or sales.

            Filter out products with inconsistent/long-term growth (focus on "breakout" trends).

    Trend Detection Algorithm

        Key Metrics:

            Engagement Velocity: Rate of increase in social media mentions/shares (e.g., +500% TikTok shares in 3 days).

            Sales Spike Score: AliExpress/Amazon sales rank changes over 7 days.

            Search Interest: Google Trends score (0–100) for product keywords.

            Geographic Heatmap: Regions driving the trend (e.g., "Product X is trending in Canada and Australia").

        Scoring System:

            Assign a Trend Score (1–100) combining weighted metrics (e.g., 40% engagement, 30% sales, 20% search, 10% geographic spread).

            Use ML to flag anomalies (e.g., a product with low sales but exploding search volume).

    Marketing Video Aggregation

        Video Source Criteria:

            Pull videos from TikTok/YouTube/Instagram that directly showcase the product.

            Prioritize videos with high engagement (views, likes) and clear calls-to-action (e.g., "Link in bio").

        Output:

            Embeddable video links + metadata (views, upload date, platform).

            Filter videos by region (e.g., "Show only videos trending in the U.S.").

    Dashboard & UI

        Primary View:

            Product List: Clean card-based layout with thumbnail, Trend Score, price range, and geographic heatmap.

            Filters:

                Trend Score threshold (e.g., "Show products >70").

                Category (e.g., beauty, tech).

                Region (e.g., "Trending in Europe").

        Product Detail Panel:

            Trend Score breakdown (engagement, sales, search).

            Historical trend graph (30-day performance).

            Embedded videos (auto-play muted previews on hover).

        Export: CSV/Excel list of products with metrics.

Quality Algorithms

    False Positive Mitigation:

        Exclude products with paid ad spikes (e.g., detect "Sponsored" tags in social posts).

        Cross-validate trends across multiple platforms (e.g., a TikTok trend must correlate with rising AliExpress sales).

    Geographic Relevance:

        Use IP analysis from social posts/videos to map trends to regions.

    Video Relevance:

        NLP to ensure videos mention the product (e.g., "I bought this [product] from Amazon…").

Key Metrics to Display

    Trend Score (Composite metric).

    Engagement Rate (Likes/Views ratio).

    Sales Velocity (Units sold/day vs. last week).

    Search Volume Growth (Week-over-week % increase).

    Top Trending Regions (List of countries/states).

    Video Performance (Views, platform, upload date).

Technical Stack

    Backend:

        Python (scraping, data processing).

        Machine Learning: TensorFlow/PyTorch for anomaly detection.

        Database: PostgreSQL (structured trend data) + Redis (caching).

    Frontend:

        React.js (dynamic UI) + D3.js (trend graphs).

        Minimalist design: Light/dark mode, zero clutter.

    Hosting: AWS EC2 (scalable) or Vercel (simpler).

Example Use Case

    User opens the dashboard and sets filters: "Trend Score > 80", "Category: Home Gadgets".

    Tool returns:

        Product: "Self-Stirring Mug".

        Trend Score: 84 (TikTok engagement +300%, AliExpress sales +200%).

        Trending in: USA (45%), Germany (30%).

        Videos: 3 TikTok links (20k+ likes each).

    User clicks product to see sales velocity graph and exports the list for supplier research.

Risk Mitigation

    Data Accuracy: Regularly update scraping logic to bypass platform anti-bot measures.

    Video Relevance: Use manual feedback loops ("Flag irrelevant video" button).
