Analysis of the TrendDrop Application Architecture
Let me first analyze the current application architecture to understand how it's set up and what modifications would be needed to create a powerful analysis dashboard.
Current Architecture Overview
Based on the provided files, TrendDrop is a full-stack application with:

Backend:

Express.js web server (Node.js)
Python FastAPI for some functionality
PostgreSQL database (with SQLite fallback)
Drizzle ORM for database operations
WebSocket service for real-time updates
AI Agent system for product discovery and trend analysis


Data Models:

Product: Basic product information and metrics
Trend: Historical trend data for products
Region: Geographic distribution data
Video: Marketing videos related to products


Services:

ProductService: Product-related operations
TrendService: Trend analysis
RegionService: Geographic data handling
VideoService: Video-related operations
AgentService: Automated product discovery and data collection


API Endpoints:

Products endpoints
Trend endpoints
Region endpoints
Video endpoints
Agent control endpoints
Dashboard summary endpoint


Real-time Communication:

WebSocket for live updates
Event Bus for internal communication



Client-Side Requirements
The client needs to be a powerful dashboard that:

Displays product information with links to wholesalers and marketing videos
Shows metrics to measure trends
Updates in real-time based on the agent's scraping
Helps users make inferences about which products to dropship
Mimics functionality of Kalodata (a data analysis platform)

Optimization Needs
Looking at the code, I can see several areas that need improvement:

Database Initialization Flow: Need to ensure database initializes properly before starting other services
Real-time Updates: The WebSocket implementation needs refinement for reliable dashboard updates
API Organization: The API structure could be improved for dashboard operations
Data Transformation: Need consistent data transformation for dashboard consumption
Agent Service Integration: Better coordination between the agent service and UI
Error Handling and Recovery: More robust error handling for the dashboard
Performance Optimization: Improved data loading for dashboard components

Now, let me outline a comprehensive plan for implementing the dashboard and optimizing the application.
Comprehensive Implementation Plan
